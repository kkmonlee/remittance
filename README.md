## About
This crazy product was created, developed and tested within 36 hours of idea birth! Our team (see authors) consisted of three developers and two financial and business geeks,
who met during the ` [African Tech Day Hackathon 2017.](https://www.africatechday.co.uk/) `

## Basic Scenario
1. Someone you know in the African continent, uses our service and sends a text to our central server, using our predefined layout.
2. You get notified about, the creation of their shopping list as they have also specified your phone number.
3. You visit our landing page, which we have created, navigating to our shopping list section.
4. You enter your number, which then filters all the shopping lists, down to the ones that have specified your numbers.
5. You can then check which ever boxes your like, with respect to the shopping lists.
6. You proceed to pay and use our secure payment system.
7. Your relative gets a text, notifying them about your payment.
8. They go to the shop they specified and pick up their goods.
